_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 3/If-Statement #1: 
Ask the user for two inputs (e.g., x, y). Then calculate and display division (e.g, x/y). 
However, make sure that your program does not divide-by-zero by checking the value of y before division. 
If y is equal to 0 then display an error message, else display the calculated division.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 3/If-Statement #2: 
The user is allowed 3 tries to guess a number (from 1-10) correctly. 
Your program should tell the user if his guess is too big or too small. 
If the guess is correct then congratulate the user and quit the program, otherwise make sure a user takes a maximum of 3 tries.
You can set any number from 1-10 as the number a computer picks (e.g., number the user must guess/find)

Week 4/Else-If Statements #6:
Write a program that asks the user for a student’s status and grade point average ( GPA ) and then determines whether or not the student should be placed on the Dean’s list.
Assume that a student is placed on the Dean’s list when he / she has full-time status and a GPA of at least 3.50 . 
Part-time students cannot be placed on the Dean’s list regardless of their GPA.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 5/While-Loop #1:

As long as the grade entered is not -1 then keep asking for grades. Once the user enters -1 then stop asking for grade input.
Based on all the grades entered, calculate the grade point average (GPA) and then determine whether or not the student should be placed on the Dean’s list.
Assume that a student is placed on the Dean’s list when he / she has full-time status and a GPA of at least 3.50 . 
Part-time students cannot be placed on the Dean’s list regardless of their GPA.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Once the user enters -1 then stop asking for number input. At this point print out the largest number entered by the user.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 5/While-Loop #4:
Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers. As long as the number entered is not -1 then keep asking for number. 
Once the user enters -1 then stop asking for number input. At this point print out the smallest number entered by the user.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 6/For-Loop #1:
Write a program that asks the user for a student’s status. After getting user status, your program must ask the user to enter 10 grades.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 6/For-Loop #2:
Write a program that asks the user to enter 10 numbers. At the end of the loop, make sure to print out out:
   smallest number entered
   largest number entered
   average of all numbers entered
   count of how many numbers divisible by 13
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 6/For Loop #3:
Write a For-loop that calculates and prints out the first 100 numbers in the following geometric sequence:
10, 30, 90, 270, 810, 2430, ...
See the following:
Example:
10, 30, 90, 270, 810, 2430, ...
The Sequence has a factor of 3 between each number.
the values of a and r are:
  a = 10 (the first term)
  r = 3 (the "common ratio")
The Rule for any term is:
(x sub n) = 10 * 3^(n-1)
So the 4th term is:
(x sub 4) = 10 * 3^(4-1) = 10 * 3^2 = 10 * 27 = 270
and the 10th term is:
(x sub 10) = 10 * 3^(10-1) = 10 * 3^9 = 10 * 19683 = 196,830
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 7/Array #1:
Write a program that asks the user to enter 10 numbers, that range from 10-100. 
Make sure that you do not accept any numbers less than 10, if a user enters a number that is less than 10 then ask him again. 
Once the user enters all 10 numbers, sort the numbers entered in ascending order and print them out.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 7/Array #2:
Write a program that asks the user to enter 10 numbers, that range from 0-100. 
Make sure that you do not accept any numbers less than 0, if a user enters a number that is less than 0 then ask him again. 
Once the user enters all 10 numbers, find and print out the median.

How to calculate the Median:

The median is the middle score of a distribution. To calculate the median
Arrange your numbers in numerical order.
Count how many numbers you have.
If you have an odd number, divide by 2 and round up to get the position of the median number.
If you have an even number, divide by 2. Go to the number in that position and average it with the number in the next higher position to get the median.
Consider this set of numbers: 5, 7, 9, 9, 11. Since you have an odd number of scores, the median would be 9. 
You have five numbers, so you divide 5 by 2 to get 2.5, and round up to 3 (to round numbers in C#, use Math.Round()). The number in the third position is the median.
What happens when you have an even number of scores so there is no single middle score? 
Consider this set of numbers: 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 7. Since there is an even number of scores, you need to take the average of the middle two scores, calculating their mean.  
Remember, the mean is calculated by adding the scores together and then dividing by the number of scores you added.
In this case, the mean would be 2 + 4 (add the two middle numbers), which equals 6. 
Then, you take 6 and divide it by 2 (the total number of scores you added together), which equals 3. So, for this example, the median is 3.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 7/Array #3:
Write a program that takes a word as input from the user. .
Your program should count the number of an vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and print out the result. 
Your program should also print out the word in reverse.
Example
word input: "queue"
Vowel count: 4
Word in reverse: "eueuq"

Hint:
  strings are arrays of characters
  string x = "hello";     //x is an array of characters
  you can access the size of the array by using: x.Length
  you can access any element of the array by using: x[i]
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 7/Array #4:
Write a program that asks the user to input 10 numbers. Your program needs to create a new array that has the number list cut in 1/2 and both halves are reversed. 
Then print out the number from the new array. You must save the new order in a new array, simply printing out the numbers will not suffice.
Example:
User inputs the following list of numbers {1,2,3,4,5, 6,7,8,9,10}
Your program needs to print out the array in the following order {6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5}
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 8/List #1:
Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers, that range from 0-100. If a user enters -1 then stop asking the user to enter numbers. 
At this point find and print out the median value.

How to calculate the Median:
The median is the middle score of a distribution. To calculate the median
Arrange your numbers in numerical order.
Count how many numbers you have.
If you have an odd number, divide by 2 and round up to get the position of the median number.
If you have an even number, divide by 2. Go to the number in that position and average it with the number in the next higher position to get the median.
Consider this set of numbers: 5, 7, 9, 9, 11. Since you have an odd number of scores, the median would be 9. 
You have five numbers, so you divide 5 by 2 to get 2.5, and round up to 3 (to round numbers in C#, use Math.Round()). The number in the third position is the median.
What happens when you have an even number of scores so there is no single middle score? 
Consider this set of numbers: 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 7. Since there is an even number of scores, you need to take the average of the middle two scores, calculating their mean.  
Remember, the mean is calculated by adding the scores together and then dividing by the number of scores you added.
In this case, the mean would be 2 + 4 (add the two middle numbers), which equals 6. 
Then, you take 6 and divide it by 2 (the total number of scores you added together), which equals 3. So, for this example, the median is 3.

Week 8/List #2:
Create and display the following menu (list of options) until the user decides to quit (selects options 3):
1) Guess a number
2) Analytics
3) Quit

If the user selects option 1, then they are allowed to guess a number (from 1-100). 
Your program should tell the user if his guess is too big or too small, then go back to showing the list of options. 
If the guess is correct then congratulate the user and go back to to show the list of options.

If the user selects option 2, the make sure to calculate and display the largest number guessed, smallest number, average number, and the number of tries. 
Also display the median number guessed.
